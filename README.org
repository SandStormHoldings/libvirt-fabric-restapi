* doing maintenance on an image
** let's mount it
1. losetup -f ubuntu-12.04-large.img 
2. kpartx -a /dev/loop0
3. mkdir /mnt/ubuntu-12.04-large
4. mount /dev/mapper/ubuntu-root ubuntu-12.04-large/
** let's upgrade it
1. chroot /mnt/ubuntu-12.04-large /bin/bash
2. mkdir /run/resolvconf
3. echo 'nameserver 8.8.8.8' > /run/resolvconf/resolv.conf
4. apt-get update && apt-get upgrade
** let's change passwords & keys
1. passwd username
2. echo 'ssh-rsa ... user@machine' > /root/.ssh/authorized_keys
** wrap it up
1. ^D
2. umount /mnt/ubuntu-12.04-large
3. losteup -d /dev/loop0
* figuring out how many public ips are currently assigned to virt nodes on each host
1. fab -R kvm list > /tmp/l.org
2. cleanup /tmp/l.org to have the following header: 
3. | host        | node_id | node_name                          | node_state |          node_mac | node_virt_ip |       public_ip | 
4. cat /tmp/l.org  | /tmp/tsorg.py list | termsql -m tabs -0 -1 \
'select host,sum(pubs) from (select distinct host,0 pubs from tbl union select host,count(distinct public_ip) pubs from tbl where public_ip is not null group by host) foo group by host order by pubs'
